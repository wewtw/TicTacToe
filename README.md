# TicTacToe
Course Project 
<h3>About: This is a TicTacToe project game from my course.</h3>
<h3>Roadmap: For the first thing I would like to implement would be score keeping player 1 won this many games etc. More seriously multiplayer without having to log in would be awesome so start type in a name play against another player.</h3>
<h3>Latest Update: Just made it work for now.</h3>
